## Domain exploration
### EventStorming - general assumptions

#### Phase 1 - Big Picture
It has the character of a workshop aimed at discovery **hot spots** . 
Hot spot can mean:
* lack of expert knowledge (regarding this part of the process)
* uncertainty
* risk

The modeling space is **timeline** .

##### Stage 1 - finding unordered events
Workshop participants search for events that are important in their process.   At the beginning, no chronology is allowed. 
 
##### Stage 2 - ordering on the timeline
At this stage, the events are arranged in chronological order. 

##### Stage 3 - reversing the narrative
In this step the consistency check is performed. Participants analyze events from the end to the beginning and reflect on what must happen before the event
 will happen.

##### Stage 4 - identyfing actors
Workshop participants successively analyze the events and identify their sources. The event source can be an actor or other system. 

##### Stage 5 - identyfing hot spots
In this step, hot spots are identified, i.e. places that are undefined and require special attention

#### Phase 2 - Process Modelling
